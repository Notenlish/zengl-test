## Credits

Big thanks to `@dom0196` and `Szabolcs Dombi` from moderngl server for the help and examples they gave. Most of the shader pipeline code is from `@dom0196`'s [pygame spring jam game](https://github.com/d-orm/pgce_2024_spring_jam/tree/main). You can go and take a look at his game here: [Atomic Convection on Itch.io](https://djorm.itch.io/atomic-convection)
